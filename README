This is a basic rails application to create written exams to print off and take with pen and paper. 

It will run perfectly on heroku.

To run locally:
Rails 3.1
Ruby 1.9.2

bundle install (you may want to run --without=production to avoid the pg gem since development uses sqlite)
rake db:setup
rake db:seed

Seeds contain a default user
email: test@example.com
password: password
